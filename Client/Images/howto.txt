                                                                                            
GOAL OF THE GAME
The goal of the game is to run as far as possible while navigating through obstacles and enemies. 
Game points will be based on how far a player is able to run. The farther a player runs, the more points player earns. 

The game is designed to be controlled by two players simultaneously. 
Player 1 will control the y axis and will have a special ability to throw javelins at the enemies encountered. 
The javelins fly straight and if an enemy is hit by one, it will get defeated (no longer pose a threat to the player).
Player 2 will control the x axis and will have a special ability to jump over obstacles and enemies.
